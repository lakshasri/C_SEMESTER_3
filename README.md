# C_SEMESTER_3
this repository contains c programming projects from semester 3, covering data structures, algorithms, and basic system applications. it includes implementations of stacks, binary search trees, priority queues, cgpa calculators

- **basic_stk** - implementation of stack operations.
- **bst** - binary search tree with insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **calc_cgpa** - calculates cgpa based on subject grades.
- **case_study** - a case study project demonstrating structured programming.
- **game_top** - a simple game-related program.
- **grade_calc** - calculates grades based on given marks.
- **graph_iterative** - iterative implementation of graph traversal algorithms.
- **mini_library** - basic library management system.
- **priority_queue_min** - implementation of a min-priority queue.
- **student_management_sys** - a student record management system.
- **temp_conversion** - converts temperature units.
- **to_do** - a simple to-do list manager.

### requirements
- gcc compiler (or any c compiler)

### compiling a program
